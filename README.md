- This project uses Entity Framework Core (EF Core) for database integration.

- The code is well-structured and functional, designed for managing books in the application. It covers primary features such as adding, updating, deleting, searching, and exiting, while also seeding initial data and providing a clean user interface.

- The implementation leverages asynchronous programming to enable non-blocking operations, such as database interactions, for better performance.

- The code is clear and functional. Adding better error handling and incorporating dynamic elements into the UI would further enhance its robustness.
